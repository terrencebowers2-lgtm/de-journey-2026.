Python is going to execute the lines of the code that we right in order. the order that the instructions are written in matters a lot.

#Creating a shape                                                                                                        
Example : Triangle
print("   /|")
print("  / |")
print(" /  |")
print("/___|")


# variable_example.py
# Examples of using variables and strings in Python

# Setting initial variables
character_name = "John"
character_age = "35"   # Stored as a string so we can concatenate easily

# Printing sentences using variables
print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ",")
print("He was " + character_age + " years old.")

# Changing the value of the variable
character_name = "Mike"

# Printing new sentences with the updated variable
print("He really liked the name " + character_name + ",")
print("But didn't like being " + character_age + ".")



# strings_examples.py
# Examples of working with strings in Python

# 1) Basic string
print("Giraffe Academy")

# 2) New line with \n
# \n tells Python to start a new line
print("Giraffe\nAcademy")
# Output:
# Giraffe
# Academy

# 3) Quotation mark inside a string using \"
# \" lets you put a double-quote inside the string
print("Giraffe\"Academy")
# Output:
# Giraffe "Academy

# 4) Using a variable and concatenation
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
print(phrase + " is cool ")
# Output:
# Giraffe Academy is cool

# 5a) Using a function: lower()
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
print(phrase.lower())
# Output:
# giraffe academy

# 5b) Combining functions: upper() and isupper()
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
print(phrase.upper().isupper())
# Output:
# True

# 6a) Indexes in Python (0-based indexing)
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
# index:  0123456789......
print(phrase[0])  # G

# 6b) Passing a parameter into a function (index)
# index("G") returns the position of "G" in the string
print(phrase.index("G"))  # 0
