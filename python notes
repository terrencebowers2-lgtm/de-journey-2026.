Python is going to execute the lines of the code that we right in order. the order that the instructions are written in matters a lot.

#Creating a shape                                                                                                        
Example : Triangle
print("   /|")
print("  / |")
print(" /  |")
print("/___|")


#variables and Data types 
1)Variable Example : 
character_name = "John"
character_age = 35
print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ", ")
print("he was " + character_age + " years old. ")
print (He really like the name" + character_name + ", ")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + ".")

2)Variable Example :
character_name = "John"
character_age = 35
print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ", ")
print("he was " + character_age + " years old. ")

character_name = "Mike"
print (He really like the name" + character_name + ", ")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + ".")

Data types are : strings,numbers, and ture or false values (known as boolean values)


#Working with strings
1) Example : print("Giraffe Academy")
2) Example : print("Giraffe\nAcademy") = the (\n) makes a new line 
             Giraffe 
             Academy
3)Example : print("Giraffe\"Academy") = the (\") adds a quotation to the string.
            Giraffe "Academy
4)Example with a variable and concatenation: phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
                                             print(phrase + " is cool ")
5a) Example with function : phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
                            print(phrase.lower())
                            giraffe academy
5b) Example with functions combination : phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
                                         print(phrase.upper().isupper())
                                          True

6a) Example of indexes in pything : phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
                                             0123456789
                                   print(phrase[0])
                                   G
6b) Example of passing parameters : phrase =  "Giraffe Academy"
                                    print(phrase.index("G"))
                                        0
