Python is going to execute the lines of the code that we right in order. the order that the instructions are written in matters a lot.

#Creating a shape                                                                                                        
Example : Triangle
print("   /|")
print("  / |")
print(" /  |")
print("/___|")


variables_example.py 
character_name = ("John")
character_age = "35"

print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ",")
print("He was " + str(character_age) + " years old.")
print("He really liked the name " + character_name + ",")
print("but didn't like being " + str(character_age) + ".")


variable_example.py
character_name = ("John")
character_age = "35"

print("There once was a man named " + character_name + ",")
print("he was " + character_age + " years old.")

character_name = ("Mike")

print("He really liked the name " + character_name + ",")
print("but didn't like being " + character_age + ". ")


string_example.py

- Basic print 
print("Giraffe Academy")

- New line with (\n)
print("Giraffe\nAcademy")
Output: Giraffe
        Academy

- Printing quotation marks 
print("Giraffe\"Academy")
Output: Giraffe"Academy

- Using a variable and concatenation 
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
print(phrase + " is cool")

- Using string functions
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
print(phrase.lower())   # giraffe academy

- Combining functions 
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
print(phrase.upper().isupper())   # True

- Indexing characters
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
# Index positions: 0123456789...
print(phrase[0])   # G

-Finding an index with .index()
phrase = "Giraffe Academy"
print(phrase.index("G"))   # 0
